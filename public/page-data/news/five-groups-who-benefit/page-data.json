However, the outdoors-averse is just one group that can benefit from the Cub Scout programming in <a href=\"https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/unit-guides/unit-guide/\">STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)</a>.</p>\n<p>Scouting America offers life-changing experiences for every young child. And they can get those experiences wherever they want in a state park, in a classroom, on a sailboat, or — more and more these days — in a laboratory. STEM comes in two flavors.</p>\n<p>First, there's STEM in traditional Scouting, including the <a href=\"https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/about-nova/\">Nova awards program</a>, STEM-based adventures in Cub Scouts, and STEM-related merit badges in Scouts BSA.</p>\n<p>Any young person who experiences STEM in Scouting or STEM Scouts will benefit. But Dr. Richard Stone, a Greater Alabama Council volunteer on Scouting America's STEM/Nova committee, sees five specific groups that seem to fit exceptionally well.</p>\n<h2>Youth not interested in the outdoors</h2>\n<p>\"Some youth are just not interested in the outdoors,\" Stone explains. \"Do they not deserve the benefits of a full Scouting experience?\" Most of us would argue they do. STEM Scouts, with labs for elementary through high school students, offers a way to deliver the values of Scouting in a unique setting.</p>\n<h2>Young people with disAbilities</h2>\n<p>First off: What's up with that spelling? Dr. Stone and his colleagues use that unusual capitalization to emphasize a young person's abilities, not their disabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, Dr. Stone tells of a young boy named Michael who has Down syndrome. The boy's mother told Dr. Stone how STEM activities had changed this Scout's life.</p>\n<p>\"This program was a great way for Michael to interact with his fellow Cub Scouts,\" the mother wrote. \"Michael learns best in a hands-on environment, and the STEM program provided that for him. As a parent of a son with special needs, I would like to applaud the Scouts BSA for encouraging all kids of all abilities to participate in the STEM program. It was a great experience for Michael.\"</p>\n<p>And then there's Todd, a Scout with high-functioning autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Todd's dad observed how STEM programs within Scouting have helped Todd improve his social skills, develop friendships, and have a greater view of the world.</p>\n<h2>Webelos and Arrow of Light Cub Scouts</h2>\n<p>Sometimes these oldest Cub Scouts and their leaders are looking for something new to try as they anxiously await the transition to Scouts BSA.</p>\n<p>STEM offers just the thing. They can start with the <a href=\"http://www.scouting.org/stem/Awards/Webelos.aspx\">Dr. Charles H. Townes Supernova Award</a>, which takes Webelos Scouts on a journey through science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>\n<h2>Scouts looking for a leg up in the workforce</h2>\n<p>STEM offers career opportunities galore, and by starting early in STEM Scouts or STEM in traditional Scouting, young people are getting a head start.</p>\n<p>\"The public, schools, and future employers see STEM as preparing youth for their future,\" Stone says. In addition, promoting STEM programs within the community will make it \"easier to convince the public that Scouting is relevant and useful.\"</p>\n<h2>Young women</h2>\n<p>STEM Scouts adds to the Scouting America's range of programming another co-ed opportunity. That means girls as young as third grade can join a lab, become Scouts and enjoy Scouting's values.</p>\n<p>These young women can continue in STEM Scouts until they graduate high school — or, if so inclined, move to Venturing or Sea Scouts once they're older.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Five Groups Who Benefit From The Scouting America's Superb Cub Scout STEM Programs.","author":"Steve Kaschiner, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"9/22/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/7eee43265ed1bf2e0fb367e57aa4369c/stem-scouts.webp"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c849aa97-6ca4-5ea9-aeb8-19069a76d8f2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1066249064"],"slicesMap":{}}
