Because we know that Scouting offers more than just incredible experiences, it helps prepare young people to succeed in life. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, today's hiring managers value \"soft skills\" far more significant than technical or computer skills.</p>\n<p>Technical skills can be learned. You can memorize business jargon, learn how to operate an expensive piece of equipment, or master a complex computer program in a few weeks or months—learning skills like leadership and teamwork? That takes time. That takes the kind of immersive experiences you can only find in Scouting.</p>\n<p>As Cub Scout adult leaders and volunteers, we learned very quickly that our work was about so much more than providing a fun and exciting experience for Scouts. It is also about compounding the values of Scouting that had been taught in the background all year long.</p>\n<p>We can recall so many instances of parents and guardians who thought we had replaced their child with someone else at the end of their experience. Yet, in just one month, their child had become more independent, more self-reliant, more communicative, and gained more confidence than through any other experience they had encountered. The 'soft-skills gap': It's real but can be closed An internet search for \"soft-skills gap\" or browse the business section of your nearest bookstore, and you'll see countless books and articles about this relatively new phenomenon.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/education/bridging-the-soft-skills-gap\">U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation writes</a> that these soft skills, including communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and time management, are essential in any career — regardless of the field. \"The importance of these skills is widely acknowledged,\" the article states, \"yet they are not taught with consistency or given prioritization.\" Except in Scouting.</p>\n<p>Every Pack meeting that a Scout is asked to lead the opening at, every campout that a Scout gets dripped on because they didn't set up their tent correctly, every service project they are asked to volunteer at — they are building soft skills. They are building character; we think it is undoubtable that today's society and today's youth need Scouting now more than ever.</p>\n<h2>Put down phone, pick up skills</h2>\n<p>More than 40% of employers say they do not see the communication and teamwork undoubtedly need in survey after survey. We believe this is what you might expect since relationships of youth are primarily screen-mediated. Many Millennials and members of Gen Z seem to prefer phones to people, we've found. Scouting doesn't guilt-trip young people into putting their phones down to live in the moment. Instead, it inspires them to do so by offering experiences they won't get anywhere else.\r\n'</p>\n<h2>A paradigm shift</h2>\n<p>The camping and leadership opportunities that have made the BSA such a critical part of our country for the past 100-plus years haven't changed a whole lot. What's different is the way we present those opportunities to families. We believe that the way we 'sell' Scouting to today's generation needs almost to turn itself around. In the past, parents wanted their children to go out in the woods and learn all the hard skills-building fires, tying knots, doing things on their own. Leaders always knew that in the background, they were teaching</p>\n<h2>Scouting's core values</h2>\n<p>Now, though, the focus, the buy-in, are those core values — building character, self-resilience, sound decision making, etc. And we do that through things like building fires, camping, tying knots. Nothing has changed, it's just a paradigm shift. The aims of Scouting are still what parents want. They just need to be sold them more directly.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cub Scouts is helping close today’s ‘soft-skills gap’ in young children","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Coubmaster","date":"9/23/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/921aa79e6aa069a206bc870e371977b8/rubiks-kid.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Today's employers are looking to hire someone with problem-solving skills, a strong work ethic, and the ability to work in a team. \"Sounds…","fields":{"slug":"/news/closing-the-skills-gap/"}},{"id":"c849aa97-6ca4-5ea9-aeb8-19069a76d8f2","html":"<p>Some young children react to time spent outdoors with delight—others with dread. However, the outdoors-averse is just one group that can benefit from the Cub Scout programming in <a href=\"https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/unit-guides/unit-guide/\">STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)</a>.</p>\n<p>Scouting America offers life-changing experiences for every young child. And they can get those experiences wherever they want in a state park, in a classroom, on a sailboat, or — more and more these days — in a laboratory. STEM comes in two flavors.</p>\n<p>First, there's STEM in traditional Scouting, including the <a href=\"https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/about-nova/\">Nova awards program</a>, STEM-based adventures in Cub Scouts, and STEM-related merit badges in Scouts BSA.</p>\n<p>Any young person who experiences STEM in Scouting or STEM Scouts will benefit. But Dr. Richard Stone, a Greater Alabama Council volunteer on Scouting America's STEM/Nova committee, sees five specific groups that seem to fit exceptionally well.</p>\n<h2>Youth not interested in the outdoors</h2>\n<p>\"Some youth are just not interested in the outdoors,\" Stone explains. \"Do they not deserve the benefits of a full Scouting experience?\" Most of us would argue they do. STEM Scouts, with labs for elementary through high school students, offers a way to deliver the values of Scouting in a unique setting.</p>\n<h2>Young people with disAbilities</h2>\n<p>First off: What's up with that spelling? Dr. Stone and his colleagues use that unusual capitalization to emphasize a young person's abilities, not their disabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, Dr. Stone tells of a young boy named Michael who has Down syndrome. The boy's mother told Dr. Stone how STEM activities had changed this Scout's life.</p>\n<p>\"This program was a great way for Michael to interact with his fellow Cub Scouts,\" the mother wrote. \"Michael learns best in a hands-on environment, and the STEM program provided that for him. As a parent of a son with special needs, I would like to applaud the Scouts BSA for encouraging all kids of all abilities to participate in the STEM program. It was a great experience for Michael.\"</p>\n<p>And then there's Todd, a Scout with high-functioning autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Todd's dad observed how STEM programs within Scouting have helped Todd improve his social skills, develop friendships, and have a greater view of the world.</p>\n<h2>Webelos and Arrow of Light Cub Scouts</h2>\n<p>Sometimes these oldest Cub Scouts and their leaders are looking for something new to try as they anxiously await the transition to Scouts BSA.</p>\n<p>STEM offers just the thing. They can start with the <a href=\"http://www.scouting.org/stem/Awards/Webelos.aspx\">Dr. Charles H. Townes Supernova Award</a>, which takes Webelos Scouts on a journey through science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>\n<h2>Scouts looking for a leg up in the workforce</h2>\n<p>STEM offers career opportunities galore, and by starting early in STEM Scouts or STEM in traditional Scouting, young people are getting a head start.</p>\n<p>\"The public, schools, and future employers see STEM as preparing youth for their future,\" Stone says. In addition, promoting STEM programs within the community will make it \"easier to convince the public that Scouting is relevant and useful.\"</p>\n<h2>Young women</h2>\n<p>STEM Scouts adds to the Scouting America's range of programming another co-ed opportunity. That means girls as young as third grade can join a lab, become Scouts and enjoy Scouting's values.</p>\n<p>These young women can continue in STEM Scouts until they graduate high school — or, if so inclined, move to Venturing or Sea Scouts once they're older.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Five Groups Who Benefit From The Scouting America's Superb Cub Scout STEM Programs.","author":"Steve Kaschiner, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"9/22/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/7eee43265ed1bf2e0fb367e57aa4369c/stem-scouts.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Some young children react to time spent outdoors with delight—others with dread.

Today, these values are just as relevant in helping youth grow to their full potential as they were in 1910.</p>\n<p>Scouting helps youth develop academic skills, self-confidence, ethics, leadership skills, and citizenship skills that influence their adult lives.</p>\n<p>Scouting America provides youth with programs and activities that allow them to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try new things.</li>\n<li>Provide service to others.</li>\n<li>Build self-confidence.</li>\n<li>Reinforce ethical standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While various activities and youth groups teach basic skills and promote teamwork, Scouting goes beyond that and encourages youth to achieve a deeper appreciation for service to others in their community. Scouting provides youth with a sense that they are important as individuals. It is communicated to them that those in the Scouting family care about what happens to them, regardless of whether a game is won or lost.</p>\n<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Scouting promotes activities that lead to personal responsibility and high self-esteem. As a result, when hard decisions have to be made, peer pressure can be resisted and the right choices can be made.</p>\n<p>Since 1910, Scouting has helped mold the future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. Scouting America believes and, through more than a century of experience, understands that helping youth puts us on a path toward a more conscientious, responsible, and productive society.</p>\n<p>Scouting, with programs for young men and women, helps meet these six essential needs of the young people growing up in our society:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring</li>\n<li>Lifelong Learning</li>\n<li>Faith Traditions</li>\n<li>Serving Others</li>\n<li>Healthy Living</li>\n<li>Building Character</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\n<p>Young people need mentors. Positive relationships with adults—community and religious leaders and, of course, parents—provide youth with good role models and have a powerful impact on their lives. Young people of every age can benefit from constructive, one-on-one interaction with adults beyond their own families. Scouting provides such adult interaction. We have a process that screens, selects, and trains the leaders who can provide that extra attention all young people need to succeed in life.</p>\n<h2>Lifelong Learning</h2>\n<p>People need to learn all through their lives. We live in a society that rewards continual acquisition of skills and knowledge. Scouting provides structured settings where young people can learn new skills and develop habits of continual learning that will help them succeed. From its foundation, Scouting has offered a concrete program of discovering, sharing, and applying knowledge and skills.</p>\n<h2>Faith Traditions</h2>\n<p>Young people need faith. There is abundant evidence that children benefit from the moral compass provided by religious tradition. We acknowledge that faith can become an important part of a child's identity. Each of the major faiths breeds hope, optimism, compassion, and a belief in a better tomorrow. Scouting encourages each young person to begin a spiritual journey through the practice of his or her faith tradition. One of the key tenets of Scouting is \"duty to God.\" While Scouting does not define religious belief for its members, it has been adopted by and works with youth programs of all major faiths.</p>\n<h2>Serving Others</h2>\n<p>Young people need to serve. The level of community service is a good indication of the health of any society. Scouting has, from its inception, been deeply rooted in the concept of doing for others. \"Do a Good Turn Daily\" is a core Scouting precept. Scouting encourages young people to recognize the needs of others and take action accordingly. Scouting works through neighborhoods, volunteer organizations, and faith-based organizations to help young people appreciate and respond to the needs of others.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Living</h2>\n<p>Young people need to be well. To get the most from life, one must be both mentally and physically fit. A commitment to physical wellness has been reflected in Scouting's outdoor programs such as hiking, camping, swimming, climbing, and conservation. First aid, lifesaving, and safety programs are synonymous with Scouting. Our programs today include strong drug abuse awareness and prevention programs emphasizing the value of healthy living habits.</p>\n<h2>Building Character</h2>\n<p>Young people need to know to be good and to do good. Few will argue with the importance of teaching values and responsibility to our children - not only right from wrong, but specific, affirmative values such as fairness, courage, honor, and respect for others. Beginning with the Scout Oath and Scout Law, the Scouting America programs are infused with character-building activities that allow youth to apply abstract principles to daily living situations.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why your kids should join cub scouts.","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"9/22/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/d0f1a20f07d78e9597cf9d199161e103/cub-scout-salute.jpg"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"For more than 100 years, Scouting programs have instilled in youth the values found in the Scout Oath and Scout Law.

The organization offers boys and girls various benefits, including friendship, education, leadership opportunities, and the chance to grow and thrive in a healthy, rewarding environment. Scouting developed during the early 1900s, when men such as Robert Baden-Powell in England and William Boyce and Ernest Thompson Seton in the United States started organizing groups of boys and girls and teaching them outdoors skills, environmentalism, and civic responsibility. Since then, scouting organizations have helped millions of boys and girls around the world. Although the term \"boy scouts\" often refers to the Boy Scouts of America now called Scouts BSA, it also might be used to refer to scouting organizations in other countries, all of which typically offer the same types of benefits.</p>\n<h2>Leadership and Cooperation</h2>\n<p>A child who participates in Scouting can expect to have a lot of fun, work hard, learn, and grow physically and mentally. Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA emphasizes both leadership and cooperation. Each local group of Scouts is further broken down into smaller groups called Packs and Dens. Each den works as a team, sometimes competing against other dens and sometimes working together with them. These essential leadership and cooperation lessons can prove helpful later in life and translate directly to working with neighbors and dealing with business associates.</p>\n<h2>Values Taught</h2>\n<p>Scouts also emphasize good living and a positive attitude. This emphasis can be seen in the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and Scout Slogan, which Scouts often recite. The Scout Oath, or Scout Promise, states: \"On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.\" There are 12 values stated in the Scout Law: \"A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.\" The Scout Slogan is, \"Do a good turn daily.\"</p>\n<p>These moral values are taught to Scouts and are practiced in community service projects. Scouts are often involved in churches and various community organizations to help the homeless, clean up parks and public areas, visit shut-ins, encourage public safety, and step in wherever needed to benefit the community. Each Scout must perform a community service project to achieve the highest rank, which is that of Eagle Scout (Scouts BSA).</p>\n<h2>Knowledge and Skills</h2>\n<p>Scouting also offers its members a wealth of useful knowledge and skills in areas such as wilderness survival, camping, fishing, photography, and science. As Scouts learn about these topics and gain new skills, they can earn merit badges and belt loops to show the topics about which they have learned. Merit badges and belt loops are available in dozens of subjects in various fields, such as citizenship in the nation, astronomy, soil and water conservation, hiking, and genealogy. By earning belt loops and adventure pins, Scouts can learn information that might be useful and develop skills and the confidence that goes with them, all of which can serve them throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Lessons for Life</h2>\n<p>The time spent in Scouting benefits a child in many ways. The friends they make, the work ethic and morality they develop, the community service they practice, and the knowledge and skills they gain can help them throughout their life. Even long after the days in Scouting are over, an adult still can remember that they should be courteous and kind and do a good turn daily.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Benefits does Scouting Offer Your Child?","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"9/21/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/b12e616072bc88638e93fa49228fdff7/next-gen-scouting-21-1_1628646296.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Scouting America is an organization that strives to give young men and women the knowledge, skills, and life lessons that will help them…","fields":{"slug":"/news/benefits-of-scouting/"}},{"id":"ea0f0406-8771-51af-b438-159e4b1b9315","html":"<p>Scouting with your child, being the parent of a Scout and a Scouter at the same time, can be one of the most enriching and memorable times you'll spend together. Naturally, there will be some difficult times, but we can avoid letting them derail the experiences for ourselves and our children if we prepare for them.</p>\n<p>Characteristics that make a good parent and a good Scouter are similar, but we will not impose the exact expectations or authority we have for our children on our Scouts. Parents are likely to be more demanding, critical, and emotional when dealing with their child—separating the parental expectations for your child from the Scouting expectations you have for them as a Scout is tricky.</p>\n<p>You will do and say things as a Scouter that make your child proud, but you'll probably say and do some things that make him cringe. They will, no doubt, return the favor. But, somewhere along the way, this is probably going to create some tension.</p>\n<p>Your child's reasons for being a Scout are different from your reasons for being a Scouter. Sure, you want to spend time with your kid but, as we'd expect, they are probably more interested in spending time with their friends.</p>\n<p>Parents and children have 'inside information' on each other. They know what goes on at home, school, and work; they know each other's history, strengths, and weaknesses. But, unfortunately, inside information is going to skew your judgment and objectivity.</p>\n<p>We need to accept that we all have \"blind spots\" with our children. Having a trusted fellow Scouter help, watch for blind spots, and lend some objectivity to this complex relationship can make things much easier for you and your child. Then, of course, you can return the favor and watch for their blind spots too.</p>\n<p>I'd urge you not to switch between the roles of Scouter and parent too often, don't treat your child as \"your child\" one minute and as \"a Scout\" the next; have a consistent approach that you and your child agree to ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Some things I see when young Scouts and new Scouters go on their first couple of camping trips are a good illustration of opportunities to keep the two relationships separate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A child wanders over to dad or mom and asks for something (a cup or a spoon or something like that) and mom or dad runs off to get it for them. If a Scout approached a Scouter with the same request, what would we do? We'd probably tell them that Scouts are expected to bring their cup or spoon and ask why they hope to have one for them.</li>\n<li>A child doesn't like the food his pack prepared and tells mom or dad to share their food with them. What would a Scouter say to a Scout in the same situation?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should discuss this well ahead of time with our children and explain that they need to accept the same responsibility for preparing and packing as any other Scout would; that they'll be eating what his or her pack brings, not what we bring, that we'll be there as a Scouter and they'll be there as a Scout. If they find that they have forgotten something, they'll speak with their Cubmaster or den leader about the problem.</p>\n<p>You may want to arrange for some specific time within a Scouting activity where you switch from the Scouter and Scout roles to the parent and child for a while. Maybe this is a few minutes before bedtime or just after a meal. You can both walk away from the group for a bit, address any concerns, share your thoughts, and then go back to the Scouter, Scout role. Discuss this idea with the other parent/Scouters and see what you come up with.\r\nThere will be times, especially with younger Scouts, when they need some consolation or help that only a parent can offer. When those times come, it's a good idea to step out of the Scouter/Scout role, step away from the group and resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>What we do as parents affects only our children; what we do as Scouter's affects other people's children. If we understand the difference and prepare our sons and ourselves to observe the boundary between the two, we'll enjoy Scouting together and better help all of our Scouts do the same.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scouting With Your Child","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/e3c991112cf7d84462d9cc9262e5bfc3/2021-08-13_23-34-12_1628912063.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Scouting with your child, being the parent of a Scout and a Scouter at the same time, can be one of the most enriching and memorable times…","fields":{"slug":"/news/scouting-with-your-child/"}},{"id":"bb3b4465-5305-5e28-b6b4-de8d6b2b1f66","html":"<h3>Welcome to Our Cub Scout Pack!</h3>\n<p>Hello and welcome to our Cub Scout Pack's website!
