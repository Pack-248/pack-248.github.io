The organization offers boys and girls various benefits, including friendship, education, leadership opportunities, and the chance to grow and thrive in a healthy, rewarding environment. Scouting developed during the early 1900s, when men such as Robert Baden-Powell in England and William Boyce and Ernest Thompson Seton in the United States started organizing groups of boys and girls and teaching them outdoors skills, environmentalism, and civic responsibility. Since then, scouting organizations have helped millions of boys and girls around the world. Although the term \"boy scouts\" often refers to the Boy Scouts of America now called Scouts BSA, it also might be used to refer to scouting organizations in other countries, all of which typically offer the same types of benefits.</p>\n<h2>Leadership and Cooperation</h2>\n<p>A child who participates in Scouting can expect to have a lot of fun, work hard, learn, and grow physically and mentally. Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA emphasizes both leadership and cooperation. Each local group of Scouts is further broken down into smaller groups called Packs and Dens. Each den works as a team, sometimes competing against other dens and sometimes working together with them. These essential leadership and cooperation lessons can prove helpful later in life and translate directly to working with neighbors and dealing with business associates.</p>\n<h2>Values Taught</h2>\n<p>Scouts also emphasize good living and a positive attitude. This emphasis can be seen in the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and Scout Slogan, which Scouts often recite. The Scout Oath, or Scout Promise, states: \"On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.\" There are 12 values stated in the Scout Law: \"A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.\" The Scout Slogan is, \"Do a good turn daily.\"</p>\n<p>These moral values are taught to Scouts and are practiced in community service projects. Scouts are often involved in churches and various community organizations to help the homeless, clean up parks and public areas, visit shut-ins, encourage public safety, and step in wherever needed to benefit the community. Each Scout must perform a community service project to achieve the highest rank, which is that of Eagle Scout (Scouts BSA).</p>\n<h2>Knowledge and Skills</h2>\n<p>Scouting also offers its members a wealth of useful knowledge and skills in areas such as wilderness survival, camping, fishing, photography, and science. As Scouts learn about these topics and gain new skills, they can earn merit badges and belt loops to show the topics about which they have learned. Merit badges and belt loops are available in dozens of subjects in various fields, such as citizenship in the nation, astronomy, soil and water conservation, hiking, and genealogy. By earning belt loops and adventure pins, Scouts can learn information that might be useful and develop skills and the confidence that goes with them, all of which can serve them throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Lessons for Life</h2>\n<p>The time spent in Scouting benefits a child in many ways. The friends they make, the work ethic and morality they develop, the community service they practice, and the knowledge and skills they gain can help them throughout their life. Even long after the days in Scouting are over, an adult still can remember that they should be courteous and kind and do a good turn daily.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 248</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Benefits does Scouting Offer Your Child?","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"9/21/2024","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/b12e616072bc88638e93fa49228fdff7/next-gen-scouting-21-1_1628646296.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Scouting America is an organization that strives to give young men and women the knowledge, skills, and life lessons that will help them…","fields":{"slug":"/news/benefits-of-scouting/"}},{"id":"ea0f0406-8771-51af-b438-159e4b1b9315","html":"<p>Scouting with your child, being the parent of a Scout and a Scouter at the same time, can be one of the most enriching and memorable times you'll spend together. Naturally, there will be some difficult times, but we can avoid letting them derail the experiences for ourselves and our children if we prepare for them.</p>\n<p>Characteristics that make a good parent and a good Scouter are similar, but we will not impose the exact expectations or authority we have for our children on our Scouts. Parents are likely to be more demanding, critical, and emotional when dealing with their child—separating the parental expectations for your child from the Scouting expectations you have for them as a Scout is tricky.</p>\n<p>You will do and say things as a Scouter that make your child proud, but you'll probably say and do some things that make him cringe. They will, no doubt, return the favor. But, somewhere along the way, this is probably going to create some tension.</p>\n<p>Your child's reasons for being a Scout are different from your reasons for being a Scouter. Sure, you want to spend time with your kid but, as we'd expect, they are probably more interested in spending time with their friends.</p>\n<p>Parents and children have 'inside information' on each other. They know what goes on at home, school, and work; they know each other's history, strengths, and weaknesses. But, unfortunately, inside information is going to skew your judgment and objectivity.</p>\n<p>We need to accept that we all have \"blind spots\" with our children. Having a trusted fellow Scouter help, watch for blind spots, and lend some objectivity to this complex relationship can make things much easier for you and your child. Then, of course, you can return the favor and watch for their blind spots too.</p>\n<p>I'd urge you not to switch between the roles of Scouter and parent too often, don't treat your child as \"your child\" one minute and as \"a Scout\" the next; have a consistent approach that you and your child agree to ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Some things I see when young Scouts and new Scouters go on their first couple of camping trips are a good illustration of opportunities to keep the two relationships separate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A child wanders over to dad or mom and asks for something (a cup or a spoon or something like that) and mom or dad runs off to get it for them. If a Scout approached a Scouter with the same request, what would we do? We'd probably tell them that Scouts are expected to bring their cup or spoon and ask why they hope to have one for them.</li>\n<li>A child doesn't like the food his pack prepared and tells mom or dad to share their food with them. What would a Scouter say to a Scout in the same situation?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should discuss this well ahead of time with our children and explain that they need to accept the same responsibility for preparing and packing as any other Scout would; that they'll be eating what his or her pack brings, not what we bring, that we'll be there as a Scouter and they'll be there as a Scout. If they find that they have forgotten something, they'll speak with their Cubmaster or den leader about the problem.</p>\n<p>You may want to arrange for some specific time within a Scouting activity where you switch from the Scouter and Scout roles to the parent and child for a while. Maybe this is a few minutes before bedtime or just after a meal. You can both walk away from the group for a bit, address any concerns, share your thoughts, and then go back to the Scouter, Scout role. Discuss this idea with the other parent/Scouters and see what you come up with.\r\nThere will be times, especially with younger Scouts, when they need some consolation or help that only a parent can offer. When those times come, it's a good idea to step out of the Scouter/Scout role, step away from the group and resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>What we do as parents affects only our children; what we do as Scouter's affects other people's children. If we understand the difference and prepare our sons and ourselves to observe the boundary between the two, we'll enjoy Scouting together and better help all of our Scouts do the same.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions or would like to visit us at one of our pack activities feel free to reach out on our contact page and we will get back to you right away.</p>\n<p>Yours in Scouting, Pack 148</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scouting With Your Child","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/e3c991112cf7d84462d9cc9262e5bfc3/2021-08-13_23-34-12_1628912063.webp"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Scouting with your child, being the parent of a Scout and a Scouter at the same time, can be one of the most enriching and memorable times…","fields":{"slug":"/news/scouting-with-your-child/"}},{"id":"bb3b4465-5305-5e28-b6b4-de8d6b2b1f66","html":"<h2>Welcome</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to Our New Site!","author":"Steve Kaschimer, Assistant Cubmaster","date":"2024-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","imageurl":{"publicURL":"/static/75ff3b096cc8c2180bbabc4d87ad4aa5/pine-forest.jpg"},"type":"News"},"excerpt":"Welcome","fields":{"slug":"/news/welcome-to-our-new-site/"}}]}}}
