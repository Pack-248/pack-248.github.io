### Tiger Den

The Tiger Den is an exciting and adventurous program for first-grade children (typically 6-7 years old). This program builds on the foundation set in the Lion Den and introduces new challenges and activities that help young Scouts grow and develop essential skills.

#### What is the Tiger Program?

The Tiger program is designed to provide first graders with a variety of fun and engaging activities that promote learning, teamwork, and outdoor exploration. Through a series of adventures, Tiger Scouts will gain confidence, learn new skills, and make lasting memories.

- **Games Tigers Play**: Learn about sportsmanship, play team games, and understand the importance of following rules.
- **My Tiger Jungle**: Explore nature, go on a hike, and learn about plants and animals in the local environment.
- **Team Tiger**: Participate in team-building activities, understand the value of cooperation, and complete a service project.
