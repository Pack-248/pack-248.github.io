### Bear Den

**Welcome to the Bear Den!**

The Bear Den is an exciting program for third-grade children (typically 8-9 years old). Building on the experiences from the Lion, Tiger, and Wolf programs, the Bear Den introduces new adventures and challenges that help young Scouts develop further skills and confidence.

#### What is the Bear Program?

The Bear program is designed to provide third graders with a variety of fun and engaging activities that promote learning, teamwork, and outdoor exploration. Through a series of adventures, Bear Scouts will gain confidence, learn new skills, and make lasting memories.

#### Key Adventures

To earn the Bear badge, our Bear Scouts will complete six required adventures and several elective adventures. Here are the core adventures:

- **Bear Claws**: Learn about knife safety, practice using a pocketknife, and complete a wood carving project.
- **Bear Necessities**: Prepare for outdoor adventures, learn about camping gear, and practice setting up a tent.
- **Fellowship and Duty to God**: Explore personal beliefs, participate in a faith-based activity, and understand the importance of duty to God.
- **Fur, Feathers, and Ferns**: Learn about wildlife, go on a nature hike, and understand the importance of conservation.
- **Baloo the Builder**: Learn basic woodworking skills, use tools safely, and complete a building project.
- **Paws for Action (Duty to Country)**: Participate in a flag ceremony, learn about citizenship, and understand the importance of community service.
