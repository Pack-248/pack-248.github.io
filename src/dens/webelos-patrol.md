## Welcome to the Webelos Patrol!

The Webelos Patrol is an exciting program for fourth and fifth-grade children (typically 9-11 years old). This program is designed to help Scouts transition from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts by introducing them to more advanced activities and leadership opportunities.

### What is the Webelos Program?

The Webelos program, which stands for "We'll Be Loyal Scouts," is a two-year adventure that prepares Scouts for the challenges and responsibilities of Boy Scouting. The program focuses on developing skills, building character, and fostering a sense of community and teamwork.

### Why Join the Webelos Patrol?

- **Advanced Skills Development**: The Webelos program helps children develop more advanced skills, such as leadership, problem-solving, and self-reliance.
- **Leadership Opportunities**: Webelos Scouts take on more responsibility and leadership roles, preparing them for Boy Scouting.
- **Family Involvement**: The Webelos program encourages family participation, making it a great way for parents and guardians to bond with their children.
