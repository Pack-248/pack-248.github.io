### Welcome to Our Cub Scout Pack!

Hello and welcome to our Cub Scout Pack's website! We're thrilled to have you here and excited to share the adventures and opportunities that await your family in our scouting community.

#### Who We Are
Our pack is a vibrant and inclusive group dedicated to fostering the growth and development of young scouts. We focus on building character, developing leadership skills, and promoting community service, all while having a lot of fun!

#### What We Do

From camping trips and hiking adventures to community service projects and educational activities, our pack offers a wide range of experiences that help scouts learn new skills and make lifelong friends. We meet regularly to plan activities, work on badges, and enjoy the camaraderie that scouting brings.

#### Getting Started

If you're new to scouting, don't worry! We're here to help you every step of the way. Here are a few things to get you started:

- **Meetings**: Our pack meets on the third Thursday of each month at 6:30pm. Location of the meetings varies but generally somewhere in Clinton Township, MI. Be sure to check our [calendar](/calendar) for any updates or special events.
- **Uniforms**: Scouts wear their Class "A" uniforms to all meetings and events unless otherwise specified. You can find more information about where to purchase uniforms and other scouting gear on our Den pages.
- **Parent Involvement**: We encourage parents to get involved! Whether it's helping out at meetings, planning events, or joining our leadership team, there are plenty of ways to contribute.
