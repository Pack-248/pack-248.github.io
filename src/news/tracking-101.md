A field guide and a magnifying glass are great tools to help you figure out which animals have been wandering around your campsite or the wild.

Watching wildlife is one of the best parts of any outdoor adventure, and spring is a fantastic time for it. As the snow melts away, animals start moving around more, searching for mates and food. Whether the ground is still snowy up north or wet from spring rains in warmer areas, it's the perfect time to spot animal tracks.

## Tracking 101 - The Basics

Animal tracks can tell you a lot more than just which animal passed by. They can show you the direction it was heading, how fast it was moving, and even give you clues about what it was doing or feeling. The clearer the tracks, the more you can learn. The best places to find tracks are in soft, wet soil near ponds or waterways, in silted riverbeds, or in areas with light snow.

To identify these tracks, look at both the front _and_ back prints. Tracks that seem similar at first glance might differ in _size_. Other clues include the _length and shape of claws_, the _width of the track_, and _the straddle_ (the distance between the right and left tracks at the shoulders).

Expert trackers often categorize animals by how they move. In her guide, _Mammal Tracks and Scat: Life-size Tracking Guide_, forester Lynn Levine explains that rabbits are hoppers, cats and dogs are walkers or trotters, bears are waddlers, and weasels are bounders. Each type of movement leaves different tracks. For example, when a rabbit hops, its long back legs pass its front legs, so the hind-foot tracks are actually in front of the forefoot tracks. Understanding these gaits helps identify tracks, especially when they're incomplete or hard to see.

"The gait also tells the story of what the animal was doing," Levine explains. She describes seeing two sets of fox tracks come together. "The tracks were close together, showing they were moving slowly, and then they intertwined in a circle, indicating where the foxes mated."

In another instance, she followed bobcat tracks that were 10 feet apart, showing the animal was moving fast and hunting. "I followed the tracks from deer bed to deer bed," she recalls.

Similarly, the gait can help you figure out if tracks belong to a pet dog or a wild coyote. "The tracks are similar," Levine says, "but well-fed pets meander, so their tracks are close together and circular. Wild animals are usually hunting, so their tracks are in a straight line and farther apart; you can see the intent."

## It's More Than Just Footprints

Besides footprints, keep an eye out for these signs:

- **Bent Grass and Broken Twigs**: These can indicate a large animal or a group of animals moving through the area. The direction of the bent vegetation can show you which way they were heading.
- **Smashed Grass**: This often points to an animal's resting spot.
- **Scat (Droppings)**: This can tell you whether the animal is a herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore. Use a stick to poke around and see what they've been eating—seed husks, berry skins, or grasses for herbivores; bones, fur, and feathers for carnivores; or a mix for omnivores.

Big cats and bears often rub bark and scratch trees to mark their territory. These marks can be as high as six feet up a tree.

## Safety First When Stalking Animals

Getting close enough to watch animals in their natural habitat is an amazing experience. But remember, safety comes first:

- **Don't Go Alone**: Always use the **buddy system**. Have at least one other person with you during any outdoor activity. While solo stalkers make less noise, it's safer to have a partner a few steps behind.
- **Keep Your Distance**: Animals can be dangerous if they feel cornered. Don't be fooled by the calm appearance of moose, buffalo, or even deer—they can become aggressive if threatened. Many animals in national parks lose their fear of humans, making them potentially dangerous.
- **Be Sensible**: Avoid stalking animals that might be interested in stalking you, like mountain lions or bears.
- **Stay Clear of Mothers and Cubs**: Never get between a mother and her cubs. Mother bears, in particular, can be very protective.
- **Don't Feed Wild Animals**: Never feed or lure wild animals with food.
- **Stay Aware**: Don't get so caught up in the chase that you forget where you are. Notice landmarks or use a GPS to find your way back.

In North America, large grazers like white-tailed and mule deer, antelope, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and elk make for great photo opportunities. To find them:

- **Ask the Experts**: Park and wildlife rangers can tell you where animals often travel. Water sources, game trails, and pasture areas are good spots to sit quietly with your camera ready.
- **Look for Movement**: Animals can blend into the background, so sweep your eyes over a large area to spot any movement.
- **Track at the Right Time**: Morning or evening light makes tracks easier to see, and many animals are more active during these times.
- **Stay Hidden**: Hide behind hedges, trees, or rocks, and stay in the shadows. If a grazing animal looks up, freeze until it relaxes.
- **Check Track Conditions**: Fresh tracks are more precise and sharp. Look for tracks in damp earth or dried mud.
- **Look For Animal Highways**: When animals travel, especially through dense brush, they often will travel single file, or continue using the same path over and over again, leaving behind an obvious path where they have been.
- **Practice Stalking**: Avoid stepping on leaves or twigs. Move slowly, placing your feet down one part at a time to avoid making noise.
- **Stay Downwind**: If you're upwind, circle around in a wide arc until you feel the wind in your face before approaching the animal.

## Helpful Tools to Have on Hand

When it comes to **binoculars**, you'll see two numbers: magnification and lens size. For wildlife viewing, something like 7x35 or 8x42 works well. Bigger lenses can be harder to keep steady. For outdoor adventures, compact binoculars are easier to carry, and waterproof ones are a must.

A **magnifying glass** (sometimes found on your compass) can help you see the details in animal tracks.

For **cameras**, a zoom lens can turn an average photo into a fantastic one. You can also use a macro lens to get close-up shots of tracks.

"Make sure you have something to show the track's exact size, like a **ruler**, a **coin**, or even **your finger** in the picture for scale," says Levine. "Track size is crucial for identification."

Using **plaster molds of tracks** is a great way to study and recognize them. However, Levine warns that making casts in the wild can be tricky because conditions are rarely perfect. She suggests using molds from Acorn Naturalists to create casts of animal feet, which you can then use to make sample tracks.

**Journaling** and **drawing** are excellent ways to remember your experiences. Writing about and sketching what you see helps lock those memories in your mind.

That's how Sir Robert Baden-Powell did it. The founder of Scouting was an expert tracker who spent countless hours sketching his wilderness observations.

Now you're a little more prepared. Get out there and observe nature and share what you found with the Pack.
